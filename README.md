# Zephyr-Projects
Projects made while learning ZephyrRTOS on ESP32 DevKitC

# Description

- Hello World 00 - First project, create the simplest app possible. It is just one, empty while loop.
- Hello World 01 - Actual hello world, it prints hello world string in an infinite loop
- Blinky 00 - Blink external LED connected to one of board's GPIOs pin. 
- Blinky 01 - Blink 3 external LEDs and ESP32 embedded diode.
- Blinky PWM - Learn how to generate PWM signal and use it to fade an LED in and out.
- Push Button Led 00 - Blink LED once button is clicked. Blinking is triggered in an interrupt.
- ADC 00 - Connect potentiometer and read its values using ADC. Values are read continously and than send using printk.
- Wi-Fi 00 - Turn on net shell in .conf file, scan for Wi-Fi and connect to one.
- Wi-Fi 01 - Scan for Wi-Fi using Zephyr API.
- Wi-Fi 02 - Connect to specific Wi-Fi using Zephyr API.
